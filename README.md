# Julie-JS-Project18-Simple-Callback-Function

This is from Traversy Media, Section 7, 63. Callback Functions.  It creates a post as a JSON object and appends a new post to it as soon as
the page loads.  The CreatePost() function calls GetPosts() so that both the existing posts and the new one are loaded.
